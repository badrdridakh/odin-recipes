# Odin Recipes Project

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This repository contains my solutions for the Odin Project's Recipes assignment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML and CSS concepts by creating a simple recipe website. Each recipe is implemented as a separate HTML page with corresponding styling. Throughout the project, I aim to showcase my proficiency in structuring HTML documents, styling content with CSS, and organizing the project in a clean and maintainable manner.

## Skills Demonstrated

- HTML
- CSS
- Project Organization
- Version Control with Git

Feel free to explore the individual recipe pages and provide feedback!
