  <h2>Description</h2>

<p> Bulgogi, pronounced bool-goh-gee, is a popular Korean barbecue dish that translates to “fire meat.
” It’s made of thinly sliced marinated meat, typically beef,  that is grilled on a barbecue or stovetop griddle. 
Despite its name, Bulgogi is not really spicy — “fire” is a reference to the hot cooking surface. 
In many Korean restaurants, tables are outfitted with grills in the center so customers can cook 
the bulgogi meat themselves and eat it straight from the grill, creating a fun, social dining experience.
Bulgogi is typically served with steamed rice, lettuce wraps, chili sauce, and other traditional Korean accompaniments.</p>
